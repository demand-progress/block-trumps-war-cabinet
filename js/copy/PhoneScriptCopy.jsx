            <p>Hello,</p>
            <br />
            <p>I am a constituent of Senator _______________ and I am calling to ask them to support the War Powers Resolution to stop U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Over eight million people are facing the threat of famine as the result of my tax dollars supporting the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen’s civil war. The Sanders-Lee bipartisan, privileged resolution invoking the War Powers Resolution, requires a vote on ending U.S. military support for this war. As your constituent, I urge you to cosponsor and vote YES on the Sanders-Lee resolution to ensure that our nation stops causing suffering in a country already devastated by conflict, cholera, and famine.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Thank you.</p>
